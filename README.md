# work-day-scheduler
Readme
During the course of completing this project I got to learn about how to utilize the time in windows and make it work in my favor. I was able to grab the current hours, link them to the time blocks and have them cycle through the time blocks turning them colors depending on whether that hour is in the past, present or future. All in all this way a fun project and made me use my brain but not to much to overwhelm me.
